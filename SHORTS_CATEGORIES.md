# Category Guide for Short Forms

## Recommended Category Structure

Here's a suggested approach to organizing your shorts with categories:

### By Type
- **thought** - Quick reflections and observations
- **note** - Brief notes or reminders
- **question** - Questions I'm pondering
- **link** - Interesting links or resources to share
- **update** - Personal or project updates

### By Topic (Optional)
- **ai** - AI and ML related
- **tech** - Technology and software
- **society** - Societal observations
- **personal** - Personal thoughts
- **meta** - Posts about the site itself

## Usage Tips

1. **Keep it simple** - Use 1-2 categories max per short to avoid clutter
2. **Be consistent** - Decide on your categories early and stick with them
3. **Lowercase** - Always use lowercase category names for consistency
4. **Mix if needed** - You can combine type + topic, e.g., `thought` + `ai`

## Example Short Forms

```markdown
---
title: "My observation"
categories: [thought, ai]
---
```

```markdown
---
title: "Check out this article"
categories: [link, tech]

The categories appear in the short forms listing and allow readers to filter by topic!
