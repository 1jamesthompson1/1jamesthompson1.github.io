# Hello
My name is James Thompson. I am a 20ish old living in New Zealand. On one side I consider myself somewhat of a Snowboarder (In the way that its what my life is built around it!), on the other side I am a right into my computers love a bit of programming. I also enjoy a good ride at the local Mtb park and making some noise on my eletric twanger (to the deteriment of my partners ears)

# Currently
I am living the mountain life in Raetihi NZ, snowobarding up at Mt Ruapehu as much as I can. To satisfy my excitment with computers I am Studying Computer Science via distance at Massey University.
