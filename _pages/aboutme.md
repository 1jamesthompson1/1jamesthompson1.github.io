# Hello
My name is James Thompson. I am a 20ish old living in New Zealand. On one side I consider myself somewhat of a Snowboarder (In the way that its what my life is built around it!), on the other side I am a right into my computers love a bit of programming. I also enjoy a good ride at the local Mtb park and exploring the outdoors.

# Currently
I am still studying as a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Massey University as a Extra mural student. This is currently my off season so me and my partner are travelling around NZ taking all the house sitting opportunities we can get.
