*I should preface this that the blog post should of been published around the end of 2023. But due to me letting it slip through the gaps it is here now, better late then never is something that I have heard somewhere before.*

This is a story about my first prototype. My first real piece of software that went through a __proper__ development cycle (whatever that is) with real stakeholders and money involved. I have done various university assignments and built some large systems within google app scripts and google drive, however this one felt unique. It is an ongoing story of a project that started relatively small but has carried on now for almost a year.

# Start

As part of my studies at Massey University I had to complete a final year project. This was completed during July to October. It constitued a third of my workload for that semester. In choosing my project I wanted something that was both novel and hard. This made me reluctant to accept any of the professors "prepared projects" as they were nothing new and just larger assignments. There was an opportunity to do a project on some education software which seemed somewhat interesting. But before commiting to this I was speaking to my father who worked at the [Transport Accident Investigation Commision](https://www.taic.org.nz/). He was looking to build a tool that uses some of the new AI technology (namely ChatGPT) to make the investigation process easier and smarter. I thought that this sounded like a challenge that ticked the boxes of what I was looking for. Therefore a [proposal](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/blob/3f74fc8bb91d20d4ce84065a65f3c3ade7613b98/Project%20documents/Uni%20documents/Proposal.pdf) was written up and accepted by my advisor and work commenced.

# Project

## Goal 

The end goal was to have a tool that would help agencies like the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commsions. It would help them in two ways by supporting them in conducting inqueries and writing the reports as well as increasing the insights and effectiveness of each published report. The more direct goal of the project was to read use a LLM from OpenAI and read each of the reports and produce a data set of a report with various summaries and ratings. This would consititue a proof of concept to show me, my father and potentially TAIC that it was possible and even useful.

## Progress

I was completing this project as a requirement of a paper I was taking. This meant that I had to devote a third of my study time to it with the rest taken up by my other courses in Mathematics and Programming. However this project also took on the role as my partime job meaning I could devote another 5-10 hours to it a week. Lastly I was living in a Campervan in Wanaka NZ so I could train for my Snowboarding competitions. Thus with 3 days up the mountain I was having very busy evenings and 4 days "at home" (If a campervan counts).  

## TAIC extension

__Talt here about the meeting with taic and how they wanted to do more work and gave me a month to bring it to a prototype.__


# Further work

After the completitiong of the prototype and giving TAIC leadership a presentation they were very excited about it and wanted further work. However I had a 2 month trip around europe booked so it would have to wait until I got back. This is where I am right now just returning from europe and about to get started on Monday with further work.

# Conclusion

Things were obsviously learnt and expereiences were had.
