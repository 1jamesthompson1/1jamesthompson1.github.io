# Hello
My name is James Thompson. I am a 20ish old living in New Zealand. I spend my days behind a computer working on problems in AI safety and AI applications. I moonlight as a snowboarding (competing in Freeride events).

I am always keen to hear about opportunities for me to use my skills in AI/Data Science to make the world a better place.

# Currently (November 2025)
Living in and around Wellington. I have recently completed my course work part of my Master of AI and am starting my research project in AI alignment which will take me through till June-ish 2026.
