# Hello
My name is James Thompson. I am a 20ish old living in New Zealand. On one side I am a Snowboarder (Freeride particularly), on the other side I am right into AI through my Computer. At the end of the day I just want to make the world a better place and see what cool things I can doe

# Currently (June 2024)
Since I have finished my studies (November 2023) I have been working more or less full time at the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission on a Data Science project. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary).
