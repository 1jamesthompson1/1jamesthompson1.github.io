  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>To help get through my workouts everyday I listen to a podcast. My podcast of choice has changed over time starting with Wesley Livesays great podcasts on the world wars (<a href="https://www.historyofthegreatwar.com/">WW1</a> and <a href="https://historyofthesecondworldwar.com/">WW2</a>) to <a href="https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/">The History of Byzantium</a>, but in the last year I have switched from history to tech podcasts and now listen to the <a href="https://lexfridman.com/podcast/">Lex Fridman Podcast</a>. So far I really enjoy the topics he discusses and the people who discuss them (even if I don’t quite agree with everything that is said). I strictly listen to podcasts in chronological order so at this time I have only just finished <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llh-2pqSGrs">episode 107</a> which has given me motivation to write today.</p>
<p>I have been quite consumed recently with the idea of my own personal luck in the ovarian lottery and what that ought to mean for me and my life. To come up with a good answer to that is beyond my time or skills but I have come up with the idea that ones level of suffering in their life should not be determined by luck. This position towards the notion that we must reduce suffering as much as possible leads to on to decreasing the expected level of suffering of a random life. The ideal goal would be that the median persons life of suffering is very low. We can’t and shouldn’t try to play god and say their should be no suffering but we should aim for the ideal. To put this in simpler words lets look at a picture.<br>
<img src="https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/give-till-what/suffering_distributions.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Two versions of the suffering distribution"><br>
Now I surprisingly am not exactly sure what the current suffering distribution is but I believe it to be something of a parabola albeit likely a bit flatter. Thus I feel there is a goal of changing the suffering distribution to move the median person all the way to the left. Now is also a good time to define what I really mean by suffering. Inventing my own definition of suffering seems to be a bit of challenge so I will loosely describe it as the effects of not having adequate food, water, shelter and health. This does cut out a lot of the developed worlds problems but these are not the priority.</p>
<p>Now that the first step of defining a goal has been mande it is important to come up with action steps to get there. To try and get a handle of the potential action space we can add some axis and bound them. Firstly we have the “how much effort scale”. On one end of the scale I could do absolutely nothing and carry on my life as usual, this would be great for me as I am in a good part of the world with good expected life outcomes. Alternatively on the other extreme I could buy a one way ticket to the developing world and spend my whole life trying to help with education or building huts etc, this would require a lot of effort and sacrifice. Now a second axis which is also important is the outcome. Worst case the outcome could be unsuccessful like trying to give food to a famine stricken country but the local warlord has sneakily corrupted the supply chain and is just stealing it all for his own use. On the other hand a greatly successful outcome is giving money directly to a collapsing community and they use it to build some infrastructure that lets them grow their own food and they become self sufficient, then they have surplus start a small research group and cure cancer (I may have gotten carried away with). This means that the action spaces look a bit like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/give-till-what/what_actions_to_take.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Action space</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There are three important extremes here. - Purple:We don’t want to be Purple as this just increases our owns suffering while reducing little to none elsewhere in the world. - Yellow: Most people are probably her which is little effort (or thought) with also little outcome. - Red: Ideally we want to aim here which I like to think of the 20% of effort that gets you 80% of the way there. Now my actions to take must to something that requires little effort (which is great because biology is inherently lazy) but has real outcome.</p>
<p>Now back to the podcast, the guest of this particular episode was Peter Singer. Now Peter Singer has lots of ideas and has written many great books. Not everything he says everyone agree with (like myself) but one of his key points he makes is we should “give till it (almost) hurts”. I really like this statement as it highlights two main points; you can probably give (much) more than you do now and that your giving won’t really effect you. If we combine this with effective giving by using some of the ideas and concepts developed from the Effective Altruism movement than it sounds like we are getting into the red zone. Therefore the action to undertake should be giving my money until it almost effects me.</p>
<p>Therefore what is my implementation going to be. Well I was already giving weekly about 5% of my income, I started this after I finished at University because for the first time I was getting paid like a real adult and had some spare money. But now really when I think about it I could give an extra 5% each week by diverting my personal “spend on whatever I want money” into some more regular donations. Thus my budget is updated and I now give 10% each week. Doing this feels like it should hurt me but it probably won’t, I can still live the normal developed world experience yet. But while living this normal developed world life I can hopefully me making some effect on the suffering distribution of the world.</p>
<p>I implore you to also think about this a bit more, listen to the podcast or use google directly yourself.</p>

  <title>My First Prototype</title>
  <dc:creator>James Thompson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/my-first-prototype/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>I should preface this that the blog post should of been published around the end of 2023. But due to me letting it slip through the gaps it is here now, better late then never is something that I have heard somewhere before.</em></p>
<p>This is a story about my first prototype. My first real piece of software that went through a <strong>proper</strong> development cycle (whatever that is) with real stakeholders and money involved. I have done various university assignments and built some large systems within google app scripts and google drive, however this one felt unique. It is an ongoing story of a project that started relatively small but has carried on now for almost a year.</p>
<section id="start" class="level1">
<h1>Start</h1>
<p>As part of my studies at Massey University I had to complete a final year project. This was completed during July to October. It made up a third of my workload for that semester. In choosing my project I wanted something that was both novel and hard. This made me reluctant to accept any of the professors “prepared projects” as they were nothing new and just larger assignments. There was an opportunity to do a project on some education software which seemed somewhat interesting. But before committing to this I was speaking to my father who worked at the <a href="https://www.taic.org.nz/">Transport Accident Investigation Commission</a>. He was looking to build a tool that uses some of the new AI technology (namely ChatGPT) to make the investigation process easier and smarter. I thought that this sounded like a challenge that ticked the boxes of what I was looking for. Therefore a <a href="https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/blob/3f74fc8bb91d20d4ce84065a65f3c3ade7613b98/Project%20documents/Uni%20documents/Proposal.pdf">proposal</a> was written up and accepted by my advisor and work commenced.</p>
</section>
<section id="project" class="level1">
<h1>Project</h1>
<section id="goal" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The end goal was to have a tool that would help agencies like the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission. It would help them in two ways by supporting them in conducting inquiries and writing the reports as well as increasing the insights and effectiveness of each published report. The more direct goal of the project was to use a LLM from OpenAI to create summaries and metrics on each of the reports. This would constitute a proof of concept to show me, my father and potentially TAIC that it was possible and even useful. To keep the scope data size manageable we limited the scope to only Marine reports from 2010-2020.</p>
</section>
<section id="progress" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="progress">Progress</h2>
<p>I was completing this project as a requirement of a paper I was taking. This meant that I had to devote a third of my study time to it with the rest taken up by my other courses in Mathematics and Programming. However this project also took on the role as my part-time job meaning I could devote another 5-10 hours to it a week. Lastly I was living in a campervan in Wanaka NZ so I could train for my Snowboarding competitions. Thus with 3 days up the mountain I was having very busy evenings and 4 days “at home” (If a campervan counts as a home).</p>
<p>To get some software that is actually useful I needed to complete a few basic features: - Data collection - Basic Analysis - Displaying analysis (As discussed later this requirement was missed in initial planning)</p>
<p>Firstly data scrapping and cleaning had to be done. This involved web scraping of the TAIC website to find all the PDF reports. There was nothing really new or interesting here. But the cleaning of the PDFs into clean text files was more frustrating than first meets the eye. Even though everyone and their dog uses PDFs actually interacting with them programmatically is quite another thing.</p>
<p>Now quickly I learnt that you cant just give the whole report to a LLMs model because a report is about 50 pages which is just way above the context limit of the LLMs at the time GPT 3.5 etc. This meaning that I was going to need to extract the “useful” stuff of the reports. I followed guidance from an investigator that it is only the analysis and findings sections of a report that have important bits of information. Fortunately for me all the reports followed the same structure with these two sections.</p>
<p>Lastly was doing something useful with the engine (some might say the important bit). My first idea was about making the engine use the smartness to summarize the reports and create a dataset where further analysis will really extract out the insights. This meant that I wanted the model to assign a percent for how much a given safety theme was involved in the accident. This worked surprisingly well. However the immediate question was what should these predefined themes be. This made me want to go back to GPT 3.5 and ask it after it has read all the reports what it thinks the main themes are. To do this I asked gpt 3.5 to summarize each reports safety themes, then from there I gave it all the summaries and asked it to generate global themes. This produced what one could call something useful. Yet as I came to learn there wasn’t time for Post-hoc analysis and so the created dataset had to be informative as possible. This meant as discovered below that a good UI for searching and reading was needed.</p>
<p>Now with all of this done it was time that I could show my father and see what he thought about it. He had heard through emails what was going on but this was the first time I was seeing him in person to show him the state of affairs. So I sat down opened up my laptop had it ready to go with vscode and I start showing some tabs of code and the output folders and it was going great for maybe 3-5 seconds. Then I realized that I am speaking to a Marine accident investigator not a fellow programmer. So I let the demo be “postponed”. Then I rapidly started building a web interface that gave a user friendly experience to using the engine. Thus the Viewer was born and my project turned from just python script files to a complete app! This webapp was developed later and is available live here: https://taic-viewer-72e8675c1c03.herokuapp.com.</p>
<p>This was more or less the end of my University project work. There is a much longer report that can be found <a href="https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/blob/main/Project%20documents/Uni%20documents/Final%20Report/21011195_159333_Final_Report.pdf">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="taic-extension" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="taic-extension">TAIC extension</h2>
<p>Once the work was completed it was time to have a meeting with TAIC. As we were only dealing with a rough proof of concept this was a small meeting with some researchers at TAIC rather than an official demo to leadership. Even though I didn’t check anything before hand fate was on my side and the proof of concept software worked exactly as I needed when giving a mini demo, the stars must of been lined up that day. TAIC liked what they saw and wanted further work.</p>
<p>This extension was about a month and took me from Mid November to 22nd of December which was going to be Demo day. There were a few item they wanted to accomplish in this sprint. These were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Expand support to aviation and rail</li>
<li>Upgrade the web viewer to be more user friendly</li>
<li>strengthen analysis by adding quotes and reasoning to the weighing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly the challenge of adding in aviation and rail. Due to my attempts at following good programming practice adding in these reports was akin to just adding in two extra input pipes into the data pipeline. It was satisfying to have the fruits of my past selfs diligence. For a great blog post I would probably put a link into the commit that shows all the changes but alas I had bad discipline and squashed a merge with too many changes.</p>
<p>With the dataset getting larger it was even more important to make the webapp useful and clean. Now this was a difficult part not because it required a great feet of software engineering but simply because I am not a web developer. This meant that the work here involved a fight between me and various python web app frameworks. Good news I won with the help of LLM upgraded the webapp to be pretty and professional looking. But even though the webapp works it is certainly not the most elegant in the back end and will probably require a revamp as it moves forward.</p>
<p>The last big ticket item was strengthening the engines analysis. This is due to the ever present question of “how can we trust what this model says”, which was becoming ever more present as the engine is saying more and more. I saw two directions to tackle this from. Firstly is in the generation phase, that is I can make something that is not only correct but verifiable. Secondly it can be done by actually verifying the output from the model. This idea is the bread and butter of statistics where you check your model output with what it should output. I had done this when doing the initial university project and it showed the outputs were familiar. However as I changed the output of the model the validation set would have to be recreated and due to time constraints this was not possible. Going into the this TAIC extension I wanted to focus on the first method to make each of the summaries, ranking etc self contained and human verifiable.</p>
<p>Making it human verifiable means that I needed to have reasoning and more importantly references within any of the text outputs. Changing the GPT 4 prompts so that it was explaining itself was not hard. The problem was to make sure that it wan’t just making things up. This part is what took the time. Fortunately checking a quote is possible as we have access to the original reports. Therefore in theory we just need to check the reference material at the given location and see if we can find the reference. Yet as with all of life’s theories, reality is a bit harder. The main problem was really just getting the GPT to output the quotes and references in a format that was consistent and machine readable. However after a good battle with the prompts and doing a bit of prompt engineering I got some where that works well enough. It cant verify and find all quotes but a vast majority of them and even repair the ones that have problems! The large outputs of the models like theme summaries and safety themes weightings for each report now had an explanation which is supported by direct references to the accident report.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="further-work" class="level1">
<h1>Further work</h1>
<p>At the end of this work there was a meeting organized for the 22nd of December with the leadership of TAIC (CEO, chief investigator etc). Unlike my other meetings this was a proper product demo. There was diagrams, power points the whole lot. However one of the craziest things about it was that I would say things in the presentation and then the attendees would scribble down notes on what I said! The presentation went well from a technical perspective as almost everything worked (except a filter to only include reports from certain year range in search results, not sure what happened as I couldn’t for the life of me recreate the error at home later). From a “business perspective” it also went well as the CEO was very keen on it and wanted to sign me up again with another contract.</p>
<p>However I had a 2 month trip around Europe booked so it would have to wait until I got back. This is where I am right now just returning from Europe and about to get started on Monday with further work.</p>
<p>This further work is going to focus its efforts on expanding the analyzed reports to also have other none NZ transport accident investigation commission. Likely the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. As well as deepen the models in other areas.</p>
<p>Where the future of this project wll lead is unknown however I am excited to still be working on my university project and making it better with every sprint.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project has had some unique aspects to it that I have not had to deal with before. I learnt and experience a much more sophisticated development cycle which involved lots of writing proposals, reports etc. but it has also given me an opportunity to really focus on a project with my full attention for some non trivial time.</p>
<p>If I started this again there are things I would do different. I wish I had built a better testing suite because I have basically no unit tests. Furthermore I am not comparing anything to a benchmark our validation set, so most of the output is only judged on whether it “looks reasonable”, which is a shame that I cant have a stronger defense.</p>
<p>I am also disappointed that I haven’t been able to incorporate true learning into this model. As rather training my own model on a corpus of data I am instead using a pre trained model. There is very short term learning in the process of the engine, yet it is not the same scale and meaning as a “real” Machine Learning project. However I have no idea what is a real machine learning project or what not. Luckily life moves forwards so I have opportunities to incorporate this and refine what is already there. It shouldn’t matter what an ideal project would look like as long as there is real usefulness it provides.</p>
<p>If you have managed to power through al of this you may be interested in all the documents that have been written in relation to this project. These can be found inside hte github repo here: https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/TAIC-report-summary/tree/main/Project%20documents.</p>

  <title>Hugo sjtravel website</title>
  <dc:creator>James Thompson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/hugo-website/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I just created a website for me and my partners travels as well as house sitting.</p>
<p>Overall the experience was great. I used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for the static site generator, <a href="https://stack.jimmycai.com/">Stack</a> as the theme and then <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> for the deployment.</p>
<p>You can find the website at: <a href="https://sjtravels.netlify.app/">sjtravels.netlify.app</a>. This could quite possibly change in the future as we decide to splash out and buy a domain name.</p>
<p>Everything about this from starting the website setting up the theme and deploying it went smoothly. Especially considering that the whole thing was free.</p>
<p>It makes me think about this website that maybe I should be moving it over to Hugo. The only things keeping me from doing that is wanting to be able to write my posts in rmd and then have it rendered and displayed as rendered html on the website. This is possible but is a pain which is why my website is setup the way it is. I will think about changing this website given how easy the process was but that is a project for another day.</p>
<section id="requirements" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The requirements for this sjtravels website were as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Good looking</li>
<li>Easy to use for non tech person (as my partner is non techie).</li>
</ul>
<p>After thinking about it using a static website was the obvious solution.</p>
<p>I knew that it could be done using Jekyll and GH pages like I have used with this site but wanted to try something a bit better. This is because Jekyll felt a bit clanky and not as smooth as I would like.</p>
<p>A quick look at Hugo website and it documentation made it my next solution and rather than messing around with using GH pages and non Jekyll (As pages by default is setup to use Jekyll).</p>
</section>
<section id="setting-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
<p>As I had never used hugo before I had to setup the software. Luckily all I had to do was follow this <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick start guide</a> and I was up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In turn getting my partners PC setup was also quite a breeze and she had to do everything from git to making a github account.</p>
<p>All of this smooth setting up was definitely giving me that good feeling that you get when things just work.</p>
</section>
<section id="site-building" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="site-building">Site building</h2>
<p>Of the things that took time in building the website we easily spent about 20% of the time just deciding on the theme. We went with a blog orientated theming. This was because the main use of the website is going to be displaying blog posts with only a few pages.</p>
<p>Because of this we didn’t want a single page site and instead wanted a home page that displayed recent blog posts and then a few other pages which would have about us and housesitting etc.</p>
<p>We settled on the Stack theme because it was easy to use and fit our requirements. I am sure there are lots more which would fit our requirements but it can be considered lucky this was the one that works. There is also a bonus that the atomic unit all the pages are folders meaning that storing assets needed for a post close by is quite easy.</p>
<p>As I have never used Hugo before so there was some warming up stage as I was just trying to figure out how Hugo and this theme works. Because of this it took another 20% of the time to get the basics configured for our website. As we got this sorted we had a website that looked something like this: <img src="https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/hugo-website/homepage.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>From here we could move on to getting stuck in to actually create the website. This meant writing and a fair amount of it. Filling this out meant the website started to a take a form that was quite appealing. We were missing any photos as we hadn’t found any that ere suitable but regardless is was all coming together. This chunk of work easily took about 40% of the time.</p>
<p>Adding the contact forms and reviews was something that needed some more of my tech hat on.</p>
<section id="forms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="forms">Forms</h3>
<p>Starting with what I know I went to pick up Google forms to make this contact form for our website. However almost immediately I knew that this wasn’t going to work the way that I wanted it to. What we needed was a very simple clean embedded form and what Google forms could offer was only large webpages that I would have to link to. This was not going to do. So I searched for a free backend to handle the form submission that my html form was going to have. This is where I found getforms.</p>
<section id="getforms" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getforms">getforms</h4>
<p><a href="https://getform.io/">getforms</a> is free so it ticked that box. It also was easy to use so it ticked that box too! However it wast completely free. Many of the useful features that I wanted were locked behind a paywall. This meant that I couldn’t have custom form submission pages, deal with notification how I liked and etc.</p>
<p>Regardless though I setup the site to work with getforms and everything was fine.</p>
<p>This was until I came to the deployment stage this morning. Where I changed it all round to work with netlify forms instead. As it was free and I could do whatever I wanted with it.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="reviews" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reviews">Reviews</h3>
<p>I would of ideally liked to have something that meant you could easily query all of our reviews. Something like the google reviews section on the internet. However sadly using this simple static builder meant that there wasn’t going to be an easy out of the box solutions. So instead I went to my trusty google sheets and collected all our reviews from the kiwihousesitter.co.nz. This meant that I now had the data somewhere I wanted. Since time was short I really came up with a terrible clunky solutions.</p>
<p>Which was.</p>
<p>Turning the sheets data into md and copying into the website. I know it is a real shame that something cool could of happened but instead I used copy and paste. Coming back to this and linking everything up to be automatic would be wonderful.</p>

<p>This gives you a string in the console and you can simply add it to the House sitting page md file.</p>
<p>I also found out that the <a href="https://symbl.cc/en/2BEA/">half star</a> unicode character is not supported somewhere in the website chain so the star rating had to be rounded to the nearest half.</p>
<p>Regardless of how it was made it did come out looking not half bad.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deploying">Deploying</h2>
<p>Now that we had the website we had to deploy it. I started by creating an account with netlify which was easy and then I gave it permissions to my repository and then I well accidentally deployed it.</p>
<p>It was just too darn easy. Well it wasn’t really deployed properly it had a weird as domain name (flocking-cats-1234 or something) and also the website was only showing an error. I went back and give it the ‘hugo’ build command I had ignored when first logging in and then it did work. Just Like That!</p>
<p>When I pushed to the main it updated the build. When I added a PR it made a preview. When I did something it just worked.</p>
<p>Very Very impressive I thought.</p>
<p>I kept seeing on the home page as I was looking around that there were forms so I had a look and in changing a single line of code set it up to use netlify instead. As it just automatically found the form and handled it which was very smart of it. The thing about netlify instead of getforms is that nothing was annoying locked behind a paywall. Instead it was simply capped. That’s alright because I don’t really expect any to actually be using our form let alone more than 50 times a month.</p>
<p>Getting the submission page to work did take more time than I would have liked but it was mostly due to my complete lack of knowledge rather than anything else.</p>
<p>The deployment process was barely a process at all. It was a few button clicks no headaches and our website was live.</p>
<p>This has left me feeling quite impressed with these web tools. As I never get near web technologies or anything to do with web development having this small detour into building a new website go so flawlessly was quite satisfying. Now as you might expect I really want to switch over my current website to this so that everything just works for me too.</p>

  <title>Rmd no more (atleast not while it is hindering me)</title>
  <dc:creator>James Thompson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/rmd-no-more/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>I had the initial goal here of having a space to help me have a space to write some words. In writing those words I was going to gain some skills in writing words in an order that works well to convey information.</p>
<p>However as one might expect I got bogged down in my efforts to get the website working. Specifically trying to get it to automatically build the rmd files to md with graphs included! This roadblock discouraged me from carrying on from using the website.</p>
<p>Regardless of all of my effort (6 months ago) it didnt work. It may work in the future and that would be great as then my blog can easily have some basic stats work in it if I want it to. What I am left with though is a website that can function quite alright at being a simple hosted blog.</p>
<p>All of the stuff that builds this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/1jamesthompson1/1jamesthompson1.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise I expect to when post things worth my time when I have said time to post.</p>

  <title>Test of building blog posts with rmd and Jekyll</title>
  <dc:creator>James Thompson</dc:creator>
  <link>https://1jamesthompson1.github.io/posts/jekyll-with-rmd/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This blog post has been moved over from my old blog format of Jekyll. Now it is working with Quarto and so this blog post no longer works</em></p>
<p>This is a test to see if I can get my rmd files to get compiled and displayed in a nice format.</p>
<p>If so then this will make the process of producing cool blog posts with data and graphs much superior then other methods. It also means that I can be developing straight into the github repo and pushing it.</p>
<p>I guess I should start using some data that I have been working with for a recent uni project.</p>
<p>Below is R code that will load the library and you can see the code.</p>
<p>{% highlight r %} library(rethinking) data(Howell1) {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>But this code below that makes the plot is hidden!</p>
<!-- ![plot of chunk Howell1BasicPlot](/figures/Howell1BasicPlot-1.png) -->
<p>However I have been told by people who are more knowledgeable then me that actually only the log of weight is relevant to height. Doh silly me. Here goes then Ill even show you what I am doing:</p>
<p>{% highlight r %} plot(Howell1<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?height,%20log(Howell1">weight), xlab=“Height”, ylab=“Log weight”) {% endhighlight %}</p>
<!-- ![plot of chunk Howell1LogPlot](/figures/Howell1LogPlot-1.png) -->
<p>I wouldn’t want to jump to too many conclusions but it looks to me that when height increases weight decreases? Wait no maybe increases? Always get stumped on these questions Ill let you decide. Now I might just test some console out.</p>
<p>{% highlight r %} x &lt;- 5 + 14 print(x) {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>{% highlight text %} ## [1] 19 {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>And now lets make sure that nothing shows up or happens at all</p>
<p>Well lets hope that this works.</p>
<p>It is proving to be difficult but I am at least learning!</p>
<p>Problem. I can get the blogdown::build_site() to make the md file from the rmd file. That works great. Then it will build the site but I cant get the images to work.</p>
<p>I am going to try put them in there original figures folder but include that in the config.yml folder.</p>
<p>I have also had to change the file path to just figures. This hopefully will work if the figures is included in the site.</p>
<p>Well it seems to be that it wants to read the images as binary files I will try putting in a different format photo.</p>
<p>Well that didn’t work. I am getting quite stuck but amd going to put it down for the evening. I was supposed to be relaxing today!</p>

  <title>Aiming to ride another day</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="backstory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>Firstly a bit of background. I spent the 2023 snow season in Wānaka (Read more about it <a href="https://www.sjtravels.co.nz/p/campervan-life-in-wanaka/">here</a>)so that I could train at <a href="https://www.treblecone.com/">Treble Cone</a> and <a href="https://www.cardrona.com/">Cardrona</a> as I am competing on the <a href="https://www.freerideworldtour.com/qualifier/">Freeride World Tour Qualifier series</a>. This training entails alot of jumping off cliffs and attempting to land back on my snowboard (feet first!). Most of the time this does actually go quite well and I end up on my feet and ride away. However on the fateful day of the 22nd of August I was practicing doing a backflip off what the locals call “the diving board” at Treble cone.</p>

<p>Now I was trying to land and ride away but instead I tore my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). This meant two things. ACL reconstruction surgery in November as well as no snowboarding for ~9 months.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-to-today">Back to today</h3>
<p>This brings us to the here and now. I am back in Wānaka slowly starting to get back onto my snowboard. I am 5 days in and have noticed a newer idea floating around my head.</p>
<p>I feel that I have heard the phrase “Atleast there is tomorrow” said alot. A statement which in my eyes catches two sentiments;</p>
<ul>
<li>life carries on and,</li>
<li>if you must you can probably try again</li>
</ul>
<p>As I get back on my snowboard I need to test my knee, regain confidence in its ability. I want to slowly push it, slowly fold open the envelope. It really does make me feel silly, like a real fool just “riding around”. Normally this feeling of lack of effort will become quite powerful. Yet these recent days I have noticed something peculiar. That when I call it a day (without doing anything spectacular) I almost feel happy and content that atleast I can still ride again tomorrow.</p>
<p>This comes from learning over the past year that some snowboarding is better than no snowboarding. I am not snowboarding just to enjoy the feeling of a turn or sweet carve, I am snowboarding to push myself and see what cool things I can do. Yet the turns and sweet carves are still magical and special in their own right. If I push myself too much, take too great of a risk I may miss out the basic magic of snowboarding as well as getting to truly see what cool things I can do on a board.</p>
<p>All of this is a long winded way of saying that I must make a decision on how much risk I want to take while snowboarding. I can push myself as far as I can go and have a higher risk of serious injury or play things safe, slowly push the envelope while keeping my body safe. To decide how much risk I am willing to take is hard. Yet maybe now after my first big injury I am happy to be a little bit on a safer side.</p>
<p>That said I am waiting on the green light from my physio and some fresh snow so I can reclaim that cliff!</p>
