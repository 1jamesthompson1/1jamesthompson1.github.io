To help get through my workouts everyday I listen to a podcast. My podcast of choice has changed over time starting with Wesley Livesays great podcasts on the world wars ([WW1](https://www.historyofthegreatwar.com/) and [WW2](https://historyofthesecondworldwar.com/)) to [The Histroy of Byzantium](https://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/), but in the last year I have switched from history to tech podcasts and now listen to the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/). So far I really enjoy the topics he discusss and the people who discuss them (even if I don't quite agree with everything that goes on). I strictly listen to podcasts in chronological order so at this time I have only just finished [episode 107](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llh-2pqSGrs) which has given me motivation to write today.

I have been quite consumed recently with the idea of my own personal luck in the ovarian lottery and what that ought to mean for me and my life. To come up with a good answer to that is beyond my time or skills but have come up with the idea that ones level of suffering is determined by pure luck. This position seems to clearly move towards the notion that we must reduce suffering as much as possible as to decrease the expected lvel of suffering if one was to randomly be born. The ideal goal would be a suffering distrubtion that was much closer to a uniform distribution.
To put this in simpler words lets look at a picture.  
![Picutres of the two distributions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/suffering_distributions.png)  
Now I not exactly sure what the current suffering distribution is but I believe it to be sumwat of a parabola albiet likely a bit flatter.

Now that the first step of defining a goal has been mande it is important to come up with action steps to get there. Now lets bound the space of actions on the "how much effort scale". On one end of the scale I could do absolutely nothing and carry on my life as usual, this would be great for me as I am in a good part of the world with good expected life outcomes. Alternatively on the other extreme I could buy a one way ticket to the developing world and spend my whole life trying to help with education or building hut or whatever. But before I make a a decision I should add another dimension which is outcomes. Therefore if the action space looks like this:  
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assests/images/post/what_actions_to_take.jpg)  
Now I think that there are three important extremes here. We don't want to be Purple as this just increases our owns suffering while reducing little to none elsewhere in the world. Most people probable in the yellow zone which is little effort (or thought) with also little outcome. Ideally we want to aim for red which I like to think of the 20% of effort that gets you 80% of the way there. Now my actions to take must to something that requires little effort (which is great becuase biology is inherently lazy) but has real outcome.

Now back to the podcast the guest of this partiuclar episode was Peter Singer. Now Peter Singer has lots of ideas and has written many great books. Not everything he says everyone agree with (like myself) but he does have one good point to make. The good point he makes is in regards to givng. That is that we sohuld "give till it (almost) hurts". I really like this statement as it highlights two main points; you can probably give (much) more than you do now and that your giving won't really effect you. If we combine this with effective giving by using some of the ideas and concepts developed from the Effective Altruism movement than it sounds like we are getting into the red zone. Therefore the action to undertake should be giving mony untill it almost effects you.

Therefore what is my implementation going to be. Well I was alreday giving weekly about 5% of my income, I started this when I started getting paid after I finished at University because for the first time I was getting paid like a real adult and had some spare money. But now really when I think about it I could give an extra 5% each week by diverting my personal "spend on whatever I want money" into some more regular donations. Thus my budget is updated and I now give 10% each week. This won't really effect me and I aught to implore you to think simliar for yourself.
