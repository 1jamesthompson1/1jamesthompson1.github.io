This is another example to show how simple it is to add shorts. Just create a `.qmd` file in the `shorts/` directory with front matter and your content.

No need to create folders or worry about complex structures. Write your quick thought, save the file, and you're done!

Each short appears as a card in the grid, and readers can scroll through them all continuously.
