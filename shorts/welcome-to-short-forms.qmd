I don't have a twitter/X account. I don't really use social media at all. I find that it provides information at a pace that is too fast and overwhelming. It stifles deep thinking and reflection.

However I still sometimes have quick thoughts, observations, or questions that I want to share without writing a full blog post or article. So I've created this "Short Forms" section of my site for that purpose. These short forms are intended to be bite-sized pieces of content, each under 280 characters (like a tweet).
