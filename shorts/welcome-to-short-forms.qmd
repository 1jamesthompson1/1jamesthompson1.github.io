This is an example short form post! These are meant to be quick, digestible thoughts and ideas that don't require a full blog post.

Keep it under 150 words, share a quick insight, observation, or update. Perfect for:

- Quick reflections
- Brief updates
- Interesting links or quotes
- Small announcements
- Micro-essays

The continuous scroll layout makes it easy to browse through many shorts at once. You can add categories and use the filter to organize them.

To create a new short, just add a new `.qmd` file directly in the `shorts/` directory, like this one!
